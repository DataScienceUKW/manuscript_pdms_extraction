            This paper describes the development and implementation of an anesthesia data warehouse in the Lille University Hospital. We share the lessons learned from a ten-year project and provide guidance for the implementation of such a project. Our clinical data warehouse is mainly fed with data collected by the anesthesia information management system and hospital discharge reports. The data warehouse stores historical and accurate data with an accuracy level of the day for administrative data, and of the second for monitoring data. Datamarts complete the architecture and provide secondary computed data and indicators, in order to execute queries faster and easily. Between 2010 and 2021, 636 784 anesthesia records were integrated for 353 152 patients. We reported the main concerns and barriers during the development of this project and we provided 8 tips to handle them. We have implemented our data warehouse into the OMOP common data model as a complementary downstream data model. The next step of the project will be to disseminate the use of the OMOP data model for anesthesia and critical care, and drive the trend towards federated learning to enhance collaborations and multicenter studies.},
